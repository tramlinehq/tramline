    # Returns a factory for the simple Cartesian implementation. This
    # implementation provides all SFS 1.1 types, and also allows Z and
    # M coordinates. It does not depend on external libraries, and is
    # thus always available, but it does not implement many of the more
    # advanced geometric operations. These limitations are:
    #
    # * Relational operators such as Feature::Geometry#intersects? are
    #   not implemented for most types.
    # * Relational constructors such as Feature::Geometry#union are
    #   not implemented for most types.
    # * Buffer and convex hull calculations are not implemented for most
    #   types. Boundaries are available except for GeometryCollection.
    # * Length calculations are available, but areas are not. Distances
    #   are available only between points.
    # * Equality and simplicity evaluation are implemented for some but
    #   not all types.
    # * Assertions for polygons and multipolygons are not implemented.
    #
    # Unimplemented operations may raise Error::UnsupportedOperation
    # if invoked.

    # [<tt>:srid</tt>]
    #   Set the SRID returned by geometries created by this factory.
    #   Default is 0.
    # [<tt>:proj4</tt>]
    #   The coordinate system in Proj4 format, either as a
    #   CoordSys::Proj4 object or as a string or hash representing the
    #   proj4 format. Optional.
    # [<tt>:coord_sys</tt>]
    #   The coordinate system in OGC form, either as a subclass of
    #   CoordSys::CS::CoordinateSystem, or as a string in WKT format.
    #   Optional.
    # [<tt>:srs_database</tt>]
    #   Optional. If provided, the value should be an implementation of
    #   CoordSys::SRSDatabase::Interface. If both this and an SRID are
    #   provided, they are used to look up the proj4 and coord_sys
    #   objects from a spatial reference system database.
    # [<tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support a Z coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support an M coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:uses_lenient_assertions</tt>]
    #   If set to true, assertion checking is disabled. This includes
    #   simplicity checking on LinearRing, and validity checks on
    #   Polygon and MultiPolygon. This may speed up creation of certain
    #   objects, at the expense of not doing the proper checking for
    #   OGC compliance. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:wkt_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKTParser.

    #   Configure the generator for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTGenerator.new.
    #   Default is <tt>{:convert_case => :upper}</tt>.

# Base interface for all coordinate systems.
#
# A coordinate system is a mathematical space, where the elements
# of the space are called positions. Each position is described by
# a list of numbers. The length of the list corresponds to the
# dimension of the coordinate system. So in a 2D coordinate system
# each position is described by a list containing 2 numbers.
#
# However, in a coordinate system, not all lists of numbers
# correspond to a position -- some lists may be outside the domain
# of the coordinate system. For example, in a 2D Lat/Lon coordinate
# system, the list (91,91) does not correspond to a position.
#
# Some coordinate systems also have a mapping from the mathematical
# space into locations in the real world. So in a Lat/Lon coordinate
# system, the mathematical position (lat, long) corresponds to a
# location on the surface of the Earth. This mapping from the
# mathematical space into real-world locations is called a Datum.

    # [<tt>:factory</tt>]
    #   Set the factory to the given factory. If this argument is not

    #   result keeps the same type as the original.
    # [<tt>:project</tt>]
    #   If this is set to true, and both the original and new factories
    #   support proj4 projections, then the cast will also cause the
    #   coordinates to be transformed between those two projections.
    #   If set to false, the coordinates are not modified. Default is
    #   false.
    # [<tt>:keep_subtype</tt>]
    #   Value must be a boolean indicating whether to keep the subtype
    #   of the original. If set to false, casting to a particular type
    #   always casts strictly to that type, even if the old type is a
    #   subtype of the new type. If set to true, the cast retains the
    #   subtype in that case. For example, casting a LinearRing to a
    #   LineString will normally yield a LineString, even though
    #   LinearRing is already a more specific subtype. If you set this
    #   value to true, the casted object will remain a LinearRing.
    #   Default is false.
    # [<tt>:force_new</tt>]
    #   Always return a newly-created object, even if neither the type
    #   nor factory is modified. Normally, if this is set to false, and
    #   a cast is not set to modify either the factory or type, the
    #   original object itself is returned. Setting this flag to true
    #   causes cast to return a clone in that case. Default is false.
    #
    # You may also pass the new factory, the new type, and the flags
    # as separate arguments. In this case, the flag names must be
    # passed as symbols, and their effect is the same as setting their
    # values to true. You can even combine separate arguments and hash
    # arguments. For example, the following three calls are equivalent:
    #
    #  RGeo::Feature.cast(geom, :type => RGeo::Feature::Point, :project => true)
    #  RGeo::Feature.cast(geom, RGeo::Feature::Point, :project => true)
    #  RGeo::Feature.cast(geom, RGeo::Feature::Point, :project)
    #
    # RGeo provides a default casting algorithm. Individual feature
    # implementation factories may override this and customize the
    # casting behavior by defining the override_cast method. See
    # RGeo::Feature::Factory#override_cast for more details.

# == SFS 1.1 Description
#
# A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a
# sequence of Points, with the subtype of Curve specifying the form of
# the interpolation between Points. This part of ISO 19125 defines only
# one subclass of Curve, LineString, which uses linear interpolation
# between Points.
#
# A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object that is the homeomorphic
# image of a real, closed interval D=[a,b] under a mapping f:[a,b]->R2.
#
# A Curve is simple if it does not pass through the same Point twice.
#
# A Curve is closed if its start Point is equal to its end Point.
#
# The boundary of a closed Curve is empty.
#
# A Curve that is simple and closed is a Ring.
#
# The boundary of a non-closed Curve consists of its two end Points.
#
# A Curve is defined as topologically closed.
#
# == Notes
#
# Curve is defined as a module and is provided primarily

  #
  # It should return either a casted result object, false, or nil.
  # A nil return value indicates that casting should be forced to

#

# == SFS 1.1 Description
#
# Geometry is the root class of the hierarchy. Geometry is an abstract
# (non-instantiable) class.
#
# The instantiable subclasses of Geometry defined in this International
# Standard are restricted to 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects
# that exist in 2-dimensional coordinate space (R2).
#
# All instantiable Geometry classes described in this part of ISO 19125
# are defined so that valid instances of a Geometry class are
# topologically closed, i.e. all defined geometries include their
# boundary.
#
# == Notes
#
# Geometry is defined as a module and is provided primarily for the
# sake of documentation. Implementations need not necessarily include
# this module itself. Therefore, you should not depend on the result
# of <tt>is_a?(Geometry)</tt> to check type. Instead, use the
# provided check_type class method (or === operator) defined in the
# Type module.
#
# Some implementations may support higher dimensional objects or
# coordinate systems, despite the limits of the SFS.
#
# == Forms of equivalence
#
# The Geometry model defines three forms of equivalence.
#
# * <b>Spatial equivalence</b> is the weakest form of equivalence,
#   indicating that the objects represent the same region of space,
#   but may be different representations of that region. For example,
#   POINT(0 0) and a MULTIPOINT(0 0) are spatially equivalent, as are
#   LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10) and
#   GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 0), LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10, 0 0)).
#   As a general rule, objects must have factories that are
#   Factory#eql? in order to be spatially equivalent.
#
# * <b>Representational equivalence</b> is a stronger form, indicating
#   that the objects have the same representation, but may be
#   different objects. All representationally equivalent objects are
#   spatially equivalent, but not all spatially equivalent objects are
#   representationally equivalent. For example, none of the examples
#   in the spatial equivalence section above are representationally
#   equivalent. However, two separate objects that both represent
#   POINT(1 2) are representationally equivalent as well as spatially
#   equivalent.
#
# * <b>Objective equivalence</b> is the strongest form, indicating
#   that the references refer to the same object. Of course, all
#   pairs of references with the same objective identity are also
#   both representationally and spatially equivalent.
#
# Different methods test for different types of equivalence:
#
# * <tt>equals?</tt> and <tt>==</tt> test for spatial equivalence.
# * <tt>rep_equals?</tt> and <tt>eql?</tt> test for representational
#   equivalence.
# * <tt>equal?</tt> tests for objective equivalence.
#
# All ruby objects must provide a suitable test for objective
# equivalence. Normally, this is simply provided by the Ruby Object
# base class. Geometry implementations should normally also provide
# tests for representational and spatial equivalence, if possible.
# The <tt>==</tt> operator and the <tt>eql?</tt> method are standard
# Ruby methods that are often expected to be usable for every object.
# Therefore, if an implementation cannot provide a suitable test for
# their equivalence types, they must degrade to use a stronger form
# of equivalence.

  # not geometry objects (returning false in such cases) in order to
  # fulfill the standard Ruby contract for the == operator, whereas
  # the equals? method may assume that any rhs is a geometry.
  #
  # Second, the == operator should always be defined. That is, it

  # test, the == operator must fall back on representational or

# A Polygon is a planar Surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or

# the Polygon.
#
# The assertions for Polygons (the rules that define valid Polygons)
# are as follows:
#
# (a) Polygons are topologically closed;
#
# (b) The boundary of a Polygon consists of a set of LinearRings that
# make up its exterior and interior boundaries;
#
# (c) No two Rings in the boundary cross and the Rings in the boundary
# of a Polygon may intersect at a Point but only as a tangent;
#
# (d) A Polygon may not have cut lines, spikes or punctures;
#
# (e) The interior of every Polygon is a connected point set;
#
# (f) The exterior of a Polygon with 1 or more holes is not connected.
# Each hole defines a connected component of the exterior.

# This module provides the API for geometry type objects. Technically
# these objects are modules (such as RGeo::Feature::Point), but as
# objects they respond to the methods documented here.
#
# For example, you may determine whether a feature object is a
# point by calling:
#
#   RGeo::Feature::Point.check_type(object)
#
# A corresponding === operator is provided so you can use the type
# modules in a case-when clause:
#
#   case object
#   when RGeo::Feature::Point
#     # do stuff here...
#
# However, a feature object may not actually include the point module
# itself; hence, the following will *not* work:
#
#   object.is_a?(RGeo::Feature::Point)  # DON'T DO THIS-- DOES NOT WORK
#
# You may obtain the type of a feature object by calling its
# geometry_type method. You may then use the methods in this module to
# interrogate that type.
#
#   # supppose object is a Point
#   type = object.geometry_type  # RGeo::Feature::Point
#   type.type_name               # "Point"
#   type.supertype               # RGeo::Feature::Geometry
#
# You may also use the presence of this module to determine whether
# a particular object is a feature type:
#
#   RGeo::Feature::Type === object.geometry_type  # true
#
# source://rgeo//lib/rgeo/feature/types.rb#53

    # Creates and returns a geographic factory that includes a
    # projection specified by a Proj4 coordinate system. Like all
    # geographic factories, this one creates features using latitude-
    # longitude values. However, calculations such as intersections are
    # done in the projected coordinate system, and size and distance
    # calculations report results in the projected units. Thus, this
    # factory actually includes two factories representing different
    # coordinate systems: the main factory representing the geographic
    # lat-long coordinate system, and an auxiliary "projection factory"
    # representing the projected coordinate system.
    #
    # This implementation is intended for advanced GIS applications
    # requiring greater control over the projection being used.
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # When creating a projected implementation, you must provide enough
    # information to construct a Proj4 specification for the projection.
    # Generally, this means you will provide either the projection's
    # factory itself (via the <tt>:projection_factory</tt> option), in
    # which case the factory must include a Proj4 coordinate system;
    # or, alternatively, you should provide the Proj4 coordinate system
    # and let this method construct a projection factory for you (which
    # it will do using the preferred Cartesian factory generator).
    # If you choose this second method, you may provide the proj4
    # directly via the <tt>:projection_proj4</tt> option, or indirectly
    # by providing both an <tt>:srid</tt> and a <tt>:srs_database</tt>
    # to use to look up the coordinate system.
    #
    # Following are detailed descriptions of the various options you can
    # pass to this method.
    #
    # [<tt>:projection_factory</tt>]
    #   Specify an existing Cartesian factory to use for the projection.
    #   This factory must have a non-nil Proj4. If this is provided, any
    #   <tt>:projection_proj4</tt>, <tt>:projection_coord_sys</tt>, and
    #   <tt>:projection_srid</tt> are ignored.
    # [<tt>:projection_proj4</tt>]
    #   Specify a Proj4 projection to use to construct the projection
    #   factory. This may be specified as a CoordSys::Proj4 object, or
    #   as a Proj4 string or hash representation.
    # [<tt>:projection_coord_sys</tt>]
    #   Specify a OGC coordinate system for the projection. This may be
    #   specified as an RGeo::CoordSys::CS::GeographicCoordinateSystem
    #   object, or as a String in OGC WKT format. Optional.
    # [<tt>:projection_srid</tt>]
    #   The SRID value to use for the projection factory. Defaults to
    #   the given projection coordinate system's authority code, or to
    #   0 if no projection coordinate system is known.
    # [<tt>:proj4</tt>]
    #   A proj4 projection for the geographic (lat-lon) factory. You may
    #   pass either an RGeo::CoordSys::Proj4 object, or a string or hash
    #   containing the Proj4 parameters. This coordinate system must be
    #   a geographic (lat/long) coordinate system. It defaults to the
    #   geographic part of the projection factory's coordinate system.
    #   Generally, you should leave it at the default unless you want
    #   the geographic coordinate system to be based on a different
    #   horizontal datum than the projection.
    # [<tt>:coord_sys</tt>]
    #   An OGC coordinate system for the geographic (lat-lon) factory,
    #   which may be an RGeo::CoordSys::CS::GeographicCoordinateSystem
    #   object or a string in OGC WKT format. It defaults to the
    #   geographic system embedded in the projection coordinate system.
    #   Generally, you should leave it at the default unless you want
    #   the geographic coordinate system to be based on a different
    #   horizontal datum than the projection.
    # [<tt>:srid</tt>]
    #   The SRID value to use for the main geographic factory. Defaults
    #   to the given geographic coordinate system's authority code, or
    #   to 0 if no geographic coordinate system is known.
    # [<tt>:srs_database</tt>]
    #   Optional. If provided, the object should respond to #get and
    #   #clear_cache. If both this and an SRID are
    #   provided, they are used to look up the proj4 and coord_sys
    #   objects from a spatial reference system database.
    # [<tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support a Z coordinate. Default is false.
    #   Note: this is ignored if a <tt>:projection_factory</tt> is
    #   provided; in that case, the geographic factory's z-coordinate
    #   availability will match the projection factory's setting.
    # [<tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support an M coordinate. Default is false.
    #   Note: this is ignored if a <tt>:projection_factory</tt> is
    #   provided; in that case, the geographic factory's m-coordinate
    #   availability will match the projection factory's setting.
    # [<tt>:wkt_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKTParser.
    # [<tt>:wkb_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKB. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKBParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKBParser.
    # [<tt>:wkt_generator</tt>]
    #   Configure the generator for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTGenerator.new.
    #   Default is <tt>{:convert_case => :upper}</tt>.
    # [<tt>:wkb_generator</tt>]
    #   Configure the generator for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTGenerator.new.
    #   Default is the empty hash, indicating the default configuration
    #   for WKRep::WKBGenerator.
    #
    # If a <tt>:projection_factory</tt> is _not_ provided, you may also
    # provide options for configuring the projected Cartesian factory.
    # For example, if GEOS is used for the projected factory, you may
    # also set the <tt>:lenient_multi_polygon_assertions</tt> and
    # <tt>:buffer_resolution</tt> options. See RGeo::Geos.factory for
    # more details.

    # Creates and returns a geographic factory that is designed for
    # visualization applications that use Google or Bing maps, or any
    # other visualization systems that use the same projection. It
    # includes a projection factory that matches the projection used
    # by those mapping systems.
    #
    # Like all geographic factories, this one creates features using
    # latitude-longitude values. However, calculations such as
    # intersections are done in the projected coordinate system, and
    # size and distance calculations report results in the projected
    # units.
    #
    # The behavior of the simple_mercator factory could also be obtained
    # using a projected_factory with appropriate Proj4 specifications.
    # However, the simple_mercator implementation is done without
    # actually requiring the Proj4 library. The projections are simple
    # enough to be implemented in pure ruby.
    #
    # === About the coordinate system
    #
    # Many popular visualization technologies, such as Google and Bing
    # maps, actually use two coordinate systems. The first is the
    # standard WSG84 lat-long system used by the GPS and represented
    # by EPSG 4326. Most API calls and input-output in these mapping
    # technologies utilize this coordinate system. The second is a
    # Mercator projection based on a "sphericalization" of the WGS84
    # lat-long system. This projection is the basis of the map's screen
    # and tiling coordinates, and has been assigned EPSG 3857.
    #
    # This factory represents both coordinate systems. The main factory
    # produces data in the lat-long system and reports SRID 4326, and
    # the projected factory produces data in the projection and reports
    # SRID 3857. Latitudes are restricted to the range
    # (-85.05112877980659, 85.05112877980659), which conveniently
    # results in a square projected domain.
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # You may use the following options when creating a simple_mercator
    # factory:
    #
    # [<tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support a Z coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support an M coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:wkt_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKTParser.
    # [<tt>:wkb_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKB. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKBParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKBParser.
    # [<tt>:wkt_generator</tt>]
    #   Configure the generator for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTGenerator.new.
    #   Default is <tt>{:convert_case => :upper}</tt>.
    # [<tt>:wkb_generator</tt>]

    #   Default is the empty hash, indicating the default configuration
    #   for WKRep::WKBGenerator.
    #
    # You may also provide options understood by the underlying
    # projected Cartesian factory. For example, if GEOS is used for the
    # projected factory, you may also set the
    # <tt>:lenient_multi_polygon_assertions</tt> and
    # <tt>:buffer_resolution</tt> options. See RGeo::Geos.factory for

    # Creates and returns a geographic factory that does not include a
    # a projection, and which performs calculations assuming a
    # spherical earth. In other words, geodesics are treated as great
    # circle arcs, and geometric calculations are handled accordingly.
    # Size and distance calculations report results in meters.
    # This implementation is thus ideal for everyday calculations on
    # the globe in which good accuracy is desired, but in which it is
    # not deemed necessary to perform the complex ellipsoidal
    # calculations needed for greater precision.
    #
    # The maximum error is about 0.5 percent, for objects and
    # calculations that span a significant percentage of the globe, due
    # to distortion caused by rotational flattening of the earth. For
    # calculations that span a much smaller area, the error can drop to
    # a few meters or less.
    #
    # === Limitations
    #
    # This implementation does not implement some of the more advanced
    # geometric operations. In particular:
    #
    # * Relational operators such as Feature::Geometry#intersects? are
    #   not implemented for most types.
    # * Relational constructors such as Feature::Geometry#union are
    #   not implemented for most types.
    # * Buffer, convex hull, and envelope calculations are not
    #   implemented for most types. Boundaries are available except for
    #   GeometryCollection.
    # * Length calculations are available, but areas are not. Distances
    #   are available only between points.
    # * Equality and simplicity evaluation are implemented for some but
    #   not all types.
    # * Assertions for polygons and multipolygons are not implemented.
    #
    # Unimplemented operations will return nil if invoked.
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # You may use the following options when creating a spherical
    # factory:
    #
    # [<tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support a Z coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support an M coordinate. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:uses_lenient_assertions</tt>]
    #   If set to true, assertion checking is disabled. This includes
    #   simplicity checking on LinearRing, and validity checks on
    #   Polygon and MultiPolygon. This may speed up creation of certain
    #   objects, at the expense of not doing the proper checking for
    #   OGC compliance. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:buffer_resolution</tt>]
    #   The resolution of buffers around geometries created by this
    #   factory. This controls the number of line segments used to
    #   approximate curves. The default is 1, which causes, for
    #   example, the buffer around a point to be approximated by a
    #   4-sided polygon. A resolution of 2 would cause that buffer
    #   to be approximated by an 8-sided polygon. The exact behavior
    #   for different kinds of buffers is not specified precisely,
    #   but in general the value is taken as the number of segments
    #   per 90-degree curve.
    # [<tt>:proj4</tt>]
    #   Provide the coordinate system in Proj4 format. You may pass
    #   either an RGeo::CoordSys::Proj4 object, or a string or hash
    #   containing the Proj4 parameters. This coordinate system must be
    #   a geographic (lat/long) coordinate system. The default is the

    # [<tt>:srid</tt>]
    #   The SRID that should be returned by features from this factory.
    #   Default is 4055, indicating EPSG 4055, the "popular
    #   visualization crs". You may alternatively wish to set the srid
    #   to 4326, indicating the WGS84 crs, but note that that value
    #   implies an ellipsoidal datum, not a spherical datum.

    #   Optional. If provided, the object should respond to #get and
    #   #clear_cache. If both this and an SRID are
    #   provided, they are used to look up the proj4 and coord_sys
    #   objects from a spatial reference system database.
    # [<tt>:wkt_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKT. The value is a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTParser.new. Default is
    #   the empty hash, indicating the default configuration for
    #   WKRep::WKTParser.
    # [<tt>:wkb_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKB. The value is a hash of

    # Note that GEOS does not natively support 4-dimensional data
    # (i.e. both z and m values). However, RGeo's GEOS wrapper does
    # provide a 4-dimensional factory that utilizes an extra native
    # GEOS object to handle the extra coordinate. Hence, a factory
    # configured with both Z and M support will work, but will be
    # slower than a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional factory.
    #
    # Options include:
    #
    # [<tt>:native_interface</tt>]
    #   Specifies which native interface to use. Possible values are
    #   <tt>:capi</tt> and <tt>:ffi</tt>. The default is the value
    #   of the preferred_native_interface.
    # [<tt>:uses_lenient_multi_polygon_assertions</tt>]
    #   If set to true, assertion checking on MultiPolygon is disabled.
    #   This may speed up creation of MultiPolygon objects, at the
    #   expense of not doing the proper checking for OGC MultiPolygon
    #   compliance. See RGeo::Feature::MultiPolygon for details on
    #   the MultiPolygon assertions. Default is false. Also called
    #   <tt>:lenient_multi_polygon_assertions</tt>.
    # [<tt>:buffer_resolution</tt>]
    #   The resolution of buffers around geometries created by this
    #   factory. This controls the number of line segments used to
    #   approximate curves. The default is 1, which causes, for
    #   example, the buffer around a point to be approximated by a
    #   4-sided polygon. A resolution of 2 would cause that buffer
    #   to be approximated by an 8-sided polygon. The exact behavior
    #   for different kinds of buffers is defined by GEOS.
    # [<tt>:srid</tt>]
    #   Set the SRID returned by geometries created by this factory.
    #   Default is 0.
    # [<tt>:proj4</tt>]
    #   The coordinate system in Proj4 format, either as a
    #   CoordSys::Proj4 object or as a string or hash representing the
    #   proj4 format. Optional.
    # [<tt>:coord_sys</tt>]
    #   The coordinate system in OGC form, either as a subclass of
    #   CoordSys::CS::CoordinateSystem, or as a string in WKT format.
    #   Optional.
    # [<tt>:srs_database</tt>]
    #   Optional. If provided, the object should respond to #get and
    #   #clear_cache. If both this and an SRID are
    #   provided, they are used to look up the proj4 and coord_sys
    #   objects from a spatial reference system database.
    # [<tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support <tt>z_coordinate</tt>. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>]
    #   Support <tt>m_coordinate</tt>. Default is false.
    # [<tt>:wkt_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKT. You may either pass a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTParser.new, or the
    #   special value <tt>:geos</tt>, indicating to use the native
    #   GEOS parser. Default is the empty hash, indicating the default
    #   configuration for WKRep::WKTParser.
    #   Note that the special <tt>:geos</tt> value is not supported for
    #   ZM factories, since GEOS currently can't handle ZM natively.
    # [<tt>:wkb_parser</tt>]
    #   Configure the parser for WKB. You may either pass a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKBParser.new, or the
    #   special value <tt>:geos</tt>, indicating to use the native
    #   GEOS parser. Default is the empty hash, indicating the default

    #   Note that the special <tt>:geos</tt> value is not supported for
    #   ZM factories, since GEOS currently can't handle ZM natively.
    # [<tt>:wkt_generator</tt>]
    #   Configure the generator for WKT. You may either pass a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKTGenerator.new, or the
    #   special value <tt>:geos</tt>, indicating to use the native
    #   GEOS generator. Default is <tt>{:convert_case => :upper}</tt>.
    #   Note that the special <tt>:geos</tt> value is not supported for
    #   ZM factories, since GEOS currently can't handle ZM natively.
    # [<tt>:wkb_generator</tt>]
    #   Configure the generator for WKB. You may either pass a hash of
    #   configuration parameters for WKRep::WKBGenerator.new, or the
    #   special value <tt>:geos</tt>, indicating to use the native

    #   Note that the special <tt>:geos</tt> value is not supported for
    #   ZM factories, since GEOS currently can't handle ZM natively.
    # [<tt>:auto_prepare</tt>]
    #   Request an auto-prepare strategy. Supported values are
    #   <tt>:simple</tt> and <tt>:disabled</tt>. The former (which is
    #   the default) generates a prepared geometry the second time an

#   embedded SRID); or <tt>:wkb12</tt> (indicating SFS 1.2 WKB
#   (i.e. Z and M presence flagged by adding 1000 and/or 2000 to
#   the type code.) Default is <tt>:wkb11</tt>.
# [<tt>:emit_ewkb_srid</tt>]
#   If true, embed the SRID in the toplevel geometry. Available only
#   if <tt>:type_format</tt> is <tt>:ewkb</tt>. Default is false.
# [<tt>:hex_format</tt>]
#   If true, output a hex string instead of a byte string.
#   Default is false.
# [<tt>:little_endian</tt>]

# This class provides the functionality of parsing a geometry from

# to recognize PostGIS EWKB extensions to the input, or Simple
# Features Specification 1.2 extensions for Z and M coordinates.
#
# To use this class, create an instance with the desired settings and
# customizations, and call the parse method.
#
# === Configuration options
#
# You must provide each parser with an RGeo::Feature::FactoryGenerator.
# It should understand the configuration options <tt>:srid</tt>,
# <tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>, and <tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>.
# You may also pass a specific RGeo::Feature::Factory, or nil to
# specify the default Cartesian FactoryGenerator.
#
# The following additional options are recognized. These can be passed
# to the constructor, or set on the object afterwards.
#
# [<tt>:support_ewkb</tt>]
#   Activate support for PostGIS EWKB type codes, which use high
#   order bits in the type code to signal the presence of Z, M, and
#   SRID values in the data. Default is false.
# [<tt>:support_wkb12</tt>]
#   Activate support for SFS 1.2 extensions to the type codes, which
#   use values greater than 1000 to signal the presence of Z and M
#   values in the data. SFS 1.2 types such as triangle, tin, and
#   polyhedralsurface are NOT yet supported. Default is false.
# [<tt>:ignore_extra_bytes</tt>]
#   If true, extra bytes at the end of the data are ignored. If
#   false (the default), extra bytes will trigger a parse error.
# [<tt>:default_srid</tt>]
#   A SRID to pass to the factory generator if no SRID is present in
#   the input. Defaults to nil (i.e. don't specify a SRID).

# === Configuration options
#
# The following options are recognized. These can be passed to the
# constructor, or set on the object afterwards.
#
# [<tt>:tag_format</tt>]
#   The format for tags. Possible values are <tt>:wkt11</tt>,
#   indicating SFS 1.1 WKT (i.e. no Z or M markers in the tags) but
#   with Z and/or M values added in if they are present;
#   <tt>:wkt11_strict</tt>, indicating SFS 1.1 WKT with Z and M
#   dropped from the output (since WKT strictly does not support
#   the Z or M dimensions); <tt>:ewkt</tt>, indicating the PostGIS
#   EWKT extensions (i.e. "M" appended to tag names if M but not
#   Z is present); or <tt>:wkt12</tt>, indicating SFS 1.2 WKT
#   tags that indicate the presence of Z and M in a separate token.
#   Default is <tt>:wkt11</tt>.
#   This option can also be specified as <tt>:type_format</tt>.
# [<tt>:emit_ewkt_srid</tt>]
#   If true, embed the SRID of the toplevel geometry. Available only
#   if <tt>:tag_format</tt> is <tt>:ewkt</tt>. Default is false.
# [<tt>:square_brackets</tt>]
#   If true, uses square brackets rather than parentheses.
#   Default is false.
# [<tt>:convert_case</tt>]
#   Possible values are <tt>:upper</tt>, which changes all letters
#   in the output to ALL CAPS; <tt>:lower</tt>, which changes all
#   letters to lower case; or nil, indicating no case changes from
#   the default (which is not specified exactly, but is chosen by the
#   generator to emphasize readability.) Default is nil.

# This class provides the functionality of parsing a geometry from
# WKT (well-known text) format. You may also customize the parser
# to recognize PostGIS EWKT extensions to the input, or Simple
# Features Specification 1.2 extensions for Z and M coordinates.
#
# To use this class, create an instance with the desired settings and
# customizations, and call the parse method.
#
# === Configuration options
#
# You must provide each parser with an RGeo::Feature::FactoryGenerator.
# It should understand the configuration options <tt>:srid</tt>,
# <tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>, and <tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>.
# You may also pass a specific RGeo::Feature::Factory, or nil to
# specify the default Cartesian FactoryGenerator.
#
# The following additional options are recognized. These can be passed
# to the constructor, or set on the object afterwards.
#
# [<tt>:support_ewkt</tt>]
#   Activate support for PostGIS EWKT type tags, which appends an "M"
#   to tags to indicate the presence of M but not Z, and also
#   recognizes the SRID prefix. Default is false.
# [<tt>:support_wkt12</tt>]
#   Activate support for SFS 1.2 extensions to the type codes, which
#   use a "M", "Z", or "ZM" token to signal the presence of Z and M
#   values in the data. SFS 1.2 types such as triangle, tin, and
#   polyhedralsurface are NOT yet supported. Default is false.
# [<tt>:strict_wkt11</tt>]
#   If true, parsing will proceed in SFS 1.1 strict mode, which
#   disallows any values other than X or Y. This has no effect if
#   support_ewkt or support_wkt12 are active. Default is false.
# [<tt>:ignore_extra_tokens</tt>]
#   If true, extra tokens at the end of the data are ignored. If
#   false (the default), extra tokens will trigger a parse error.
# [<tt>:default_srid</tt>]
#   A SRID to pass to the factory generator if no SRID is present in
#   the input. Defaults to nil (i.e. don't specify a SRID).
