## Features ‚ú®

#### Release Trains
With our dynamic workflow model, you can setup multiple trains and steps that chug along different deployment channels.
#### Integrations
We integrate with all the essential tools you need, including VCS, Notifications, CI/CD, and both App Store and Google Play Store. And we're always expanding to include even more.
#### Release Dashboards
A control center where you can monitor all your releases and their statuses from one convenient location.
#### Analytics
Track all the release metadata you need to make informed decisions. From frequency and cycle time to build times and review times.
#### Automations
Cutting release branches to submitting builds to stores, many things are already automatic and many more to come soon! [Keep an eye out](https://www.tramline.app/integrations)!

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è


To self-host Tramline on Render, follow these instructions. These steps can also be adapted for a Heroku deployment. Instructions for other platforms, including a dockerized setup will come in the future.

**Note:** Since Render does not offer background workers under the free plan, you will have to put in your payment details to fully complete this deployment.

#### Requirements

You'll need the following minimum to get Tramline up and running:

- This repository set up as the primary monolithic backend
- This repository set up as a background worker
- Postgres database
- Redis instance (preferably persistent)

You'll also need to set up integrations for Tramline to be useful:

* [Postmark API token](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1008-what-are-the-account-and-server-api-tokens)
* [Google Cloud Service Account](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/google-cloud-storage-backup/#create-a-service-account)
* [Creating a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics)
* [Creating a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)

#### Setting up integration apps

The guides above should help you setup the OAuth apps as necessary. They may ask you to fill up a redirect URL, this URL should be updated with the final DNS after everything is setup towards the end.

#### Google Cloud Platform

We need to setup GCP for storing builds in Tramline. After creating your service account as mentioned above, please create a GCS bucket named `artifact-builds-prod` to host your builds.


#### Setting up Tramline

The deployment architecture looks like this:

<figure>
  <img alt="setup architecture" src="art/overall-arch@1x.png" width="90%" />
</figure>

To begin, first clone this repo. This ensures everything that you do is fully under your control.

In case you'd like to run this locally first, please follow [Development](#development-).

To host Tramline directly, you'll need to prep your fork:

#### Set up Rails

```bash
bin/setup.mac
```

#### Generate production credentials and follow the instructions

```bash
bin/setup.creds -e prod
```

Keep the `production.key` file safe and don't commit it.

#### Update production credentials

After adding the encryption credentials, fill in the following details for the integrations in `production.yml.enc` by running `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment production`.

Follow the links mentioned earlier to setup the bare-minimum integrations.

For `applelink`, choose any string as your `secret`. We will use this later.

Use the following template:

```yaml
active_record_encryption:
  primary_key:
  deterministic_key:
  key_derivation_salt:

secret_key_base:

dependencies:
  postmark:
    api_token:

  gcp:
    project_id:
    private_key_id:
    private_key: |
    client_email:
    client_id:
    client_x509_cert_url:

integrations:
  slack:
    app_id:
    client_id:
    client_secret:
    signing_secret:
    verification_token:
    scopes: "app_mentions:read,channels:join,channels:manage,channels:read,chat:write,chat:write.public,files:write,groups:read,groups:write,im:read,im:write,usergroups:read,users.profile:read,users:read,users:read.email,commands,usergroups:write"

  applelink:
    iss: "tramline"
    aud: "applelink"
    secret: "any password"

  github:
    app_name:
    app_id:
    private_pem: |
```
Save the credentials file and commit your changes. Use this button **from your fork** to kick-off a Render deployment.

<p>
  <a href="https://render.com/deploy" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render">
  </a>
</p>

The blueprint will ask for the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`. Use the contents of `production.key` from the previous step.

#### Setup applelink

If you would like to use the App Store integration, you'd have to configure the `applelink` service. You can skip this section otherwise.

1. To start off, in your fork, uncomment the `applelink` section from the `render.yaml` file.
2. Secondly, to your encryption file, add this to the integrations section, by running `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment production`. Choose a secret key for authorization.

```yaml
integrations:
  applelink:
    iss: "tramline.dev"
    aud: "applelink"
    secret: "any password"
```

3. Commit your changes and resync the blueprint on Render. This will kick-off the `applelink` service. This will most likely fail to deploy on the first attempt, because it requires certain environment configuration. To do that, create a `Secret File` under `applelink > Settings > Environment > Secret Files` called `.env` and update with the following details by putting the applelink secret from the previous step under `AUTH_SECRET`:

```
RACK_ENV=production
WEB_CONCURRENCY=2
MAX_THREADS=1
PORT=3001
AUTH_ISSUER="tramline"
AUTH_AUD="applelink"
AUTH_SECRET=""
SENTRY_DSN=""
```

#### Wrap up

Before we wrap up, we need to fix a couple of ENV variables:

1. If you have setup applelink in the previous step, you must add an `APPLELINK_URL` to `site-web` with the final DNS of the `applelink` service.
2. The `HOSTNAME` in `site-web` and `site-jobs` must be updated to point to the DNS of `site-web` (without the protocol).

Once all services on Render are green, your setup should look like this:

<figure>
  <img alt="render.com services" src="art/render_dotcom_services.png" width="90%" />
</figure>

That should be it! You can use the default DNS from `site-web` to launch Tramline. You can configure and tweak more settings later.

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

#### Setup

For local development on macOS, clone this repository and run the included setup script:

```
bin/setup.mac
```

**Note:** If you already have a previous dev environment that you're trying to refresh, the easiest thing to do is to
drop your database and run setup again.

```bash
rails db:drop
bin/setup.mac
```

Refer to `db/seeds.rb` for credentials on how to login using the seed users.

#### Running

- Place the `master.key` file in the `config` directory.
- Start [ngrok](#webhooks).
- Start PostgreSQL and Redis using [Homebrew services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services).
- Finally, run `bin/dev`.

#### Webhooks

Webhooks need access to the application over the Internet and that requires tunneling on the localhost environment. We
use ngrok, and you should run it like this:

```bash
ngrok http https://localhost:3000
```

If you'd like to use the custom DNS tunnel, add the following to your ngrok config file,

```yaml
version: "2"
authtoken: # put your authtoken
region: in
tunnels:
  tramline_dev:
    proto: http
    hostname: # add the tunnel hostname
    addr: https://localhost:3000
```

You can run this configured tunnel via

```bash
ngrok start tramline_dev
```

or through the `Procfile.dev`

#### Adding or updating gems

* Use `bundle add <gem>` to add a new gem.
* To update a gem use `bundle update <gem>`.

Using the `bundle add` tool auto-applies
the [pessimistic operator](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/rubys-pessimistic-operator) in the `Gemfile`.
Although `Gemfile.lock` is the correct source of gem versions, specifying the pessimistic operator makes for a simpler
and safer update path through bundler for future users.

Doing this for development/test groups is optional.

#### SSL

We use SSL locally and certificates are also generated as part of the setup script. It's recommended to
use https://tramline.local.gd:3000.

This is the default `HOST_NAME` that can be changed via `.env.development` if necessary.

#### Letter Opener

All e-mails are caught and can be viewed [here](https://tramline.local.gd:3000/letter_opener).

#### Sidekiq

The dashboard for all background jobs can be viewed [here](https://tramline.local.gd:3000/sidekiq).

#### Flipper

All feature-flags are managed through flipper. The UI can be viewed [here](https://tramline.local.gd:3000/flipper).
